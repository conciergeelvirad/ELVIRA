# Email Notification Integration - Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully integrated email notifications into all three cart systems (Shop, DineIn, Services) using the `send-order-notification-email` edge function.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Email Service Utility

**File:** `src/services/orderEmailNotification.service.ts`

- **Purpose:** Wrapper service for invoking the email edge function
- **Function:** `sendOrderNotificationEmail(data: OrderEmailData)`
- **Edge Function:** Calls `send-order-notification-email`
- **Error Handling:** Returns `{ success: boolean; error?: string }`

#### OrderEmailData Interface

```typescript
interface OrderEmailData {
  guestName: string;
  guestEmail: string;
  roomNumber: string;
  hotelName: string;
  orderType: "shop" | "dine_in" | "amenity";
  orderId: string;
  orderStatus: string;
  orderDetails: {
    // Shop fields
    shopItems?: Array<{ name: string; quantity: number; price: number }>;
    shopTotalPrice?: number;
    shopDeliveryDate?: string;
    shopDeliveryTime?: string;

    // DineIn fields
    restaurantName?: string;
    orderItems?: Array<{ name: string; quantity: number; price: number }>;
    totalPrice?: number;
    deliveryDate?: string;
    deliveryTime?: string;
    reservationDate?: string;
    reservationTime?: string;
    numberOfGuests?: number;
    tablePreferences?: string;

    // Amenity fields
    amenityName?: string;
    amenityCategory?: string;
    amenityPrice?: string;
    requestDate?: string;
    requestTime?: string;
    specialInstructions?: string;
  };
}
```

### 2. Shop Cart Integration

**File:** `src/pages/Guests/components/ShopCart/ShopCartBottomSheet.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Imported `sendOrderNotificationEmail` service
- Captured order result to get `orderId`
- Extracted guest email from `guest_personal_data`
- Sent email notification after successful order creation
- Error handling: Logs email failures but doesn't block order success

**Email Data Sent:**

```typescript
{
  orderType: "shop",
  guestName: session.guestData.guest_name,
  guestEmail: extracted from guest_personal_data,
  roomNumber: session.guestData.room_number,
  hotelName: session.hotelData.name,
  orderId: result.id,
  orderStatus: "pending",
  orderDetails: {
    shopItems: [{ name, quantity, price }],
    shopTotalPrice: totalPrice,
    shopDeliveryDate: deliveryDate,
    shopDeliveryTime: deliveryTime,
    specialInstructions: specialInstructions
  }
}
```

### 3. DineIn Cart Integration

**File:** `src/pages/Guests/components/DineInCart/DineInCartBottomSheet.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Imported `sendOrderNotificationEmail` service
- Captured order result to get `orderId`
- Extracted guest email from `guest_personal_data`
- Extracted restaurant name (defaulting to "Hotel Restaurant")
- Sent email notification after successful order creation
- Conditional fields based on service type (restaurant_booking vs room_service)
- Error handling: Logs email failures but doesn't block order success

**Email Data Sent:**

```typescript
{
  orderType: "dine_in",
  guestName: session.guestData.guest_name,
  guestEmail: extracted from guest_personal_data,
  roomNumber: session.guestData.room_number,
  hotelName: session.hotelData.name,
  orderId: result.id,
  orderStatus: "pending",
  orderDetails: {
    restaurantName: "Hotel Restaurant",
    orderItems: [{ name, quantity, price }],
    totalPrice: totalPrice,
    specialInstructions: specialInstructions,

    // Restaurant booking specific
    reservationDate: reservationDate,
    reservationTime: reservationTime,
    numberOfGuests: numberOfGuests,
    tablePreferences: tablePreferences,

    // Room service specific
    deliveryDate: deliveryDate,
    deliveryTime: deliveryTime
  }
}
```

### 4. Services Cart Integration

**File:** `src/pages/Guests/components/ServicesCart/ServicesCartBottomSheet.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Imported `sendOrderNotificationEmail` service
- Extracted guest email from `guest_personal_data`
- Sent **multiple emails** (one per amenity) using `Promise.all()`
- Each amenity request gets its own email notification
- Error handling: Logs email failures but doesn't block request success

**Email Data Sent (per amenity):**

```typescript
{
  orderType: "amenity",
  guestName: session.guestData.guest_name,
  guestEmail: extracted from guest_personal_data,
  roomNumber: session.guestData.room_number,
  hotelName: session.hotelData.name,
  orderId: "N/A", // Bulk creation doesn't return individual IDs
  orderStatus: "pending",
  orderDetails: {
    amenityName: item.name,
    amenityCategory: "Service",
    amenityPrice: `$${item.price.toFixed(2)}`,
    requestDate: requestDate,
    requestTime: requestTime,
    specialInstructions: specialInstructions
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### Guest Email Extraction

All three implementations use the same pattern to safely extract guest email:

```typescript
const guestPersonalData = session?.guestData?.guest_personal_data;
const guestEmail = Array.isArray(guestPersonalData)
  ? guestPersonalData[0]?.guest_email || ""
  : guestPersonalData?.guest_email || "";
```

This handles both array and single object formats of `guest_personal_data`.

### Error Handling Strategy

```typescript
try {
  await sendOrderNotificationEmail(emailData);
} catch (emailError) {
  // Log email error but don't block order success
  console.error("⚠️ [Cart] Email notification failed:", emailError);
}
```

- Email failures are **logged but don't block** the order/request success
- Guest still receives visual confirmation via SuccessModal
- Order/request is still created in database
- Staff can see failed email attempts in console logs

### Data Flow

1. Guest completes checkout in cart
2. Order/request is created in database
3. Order ID is captured from mutation result
4. Guest and hotel data extracted from session
5. Email notification sent via edge function
6. Edge function invokes Resend API
7. Success modal shown to guest
8. Cart is cleared

## Edge Function Integration

### Edge Function: `send-order-notification-email`

**Location:** Supabase Edge Functions

**Features:**

- Uses Resend API for email delivery
- Supports 3 order types: `shop`, `dine_in`, `amenity`
- Generates HTML and text email templates
- Includes order-specific details in email body
- Returns success/error status

**Email Templates:**

- **Shop Orders:** Product list, quantities, total price, delivery date/time
- **DineIn Orders:** Menu items, reservation/delivery details, restaurant info
- **Amenity Requests:** Amenity name, category, price, request date/time

## Environment Requirements

### Supabase Setup

1. **Edge Function Deployed:** `send-order-notification-email` must be deployed
2. **Resend API Key:** Must be configured in edge function environment
3. **Supabase URL:** Must be accessible from frontend
4. **Supabase Anon Key:** Must be configured in frontend

### Guest Session Requirements

1. **Guest Authentication:** Guest must be logged in
2. **Guest Email:** Must be provided in `guest_personal_data`
3. **Hotel Data:** Hotel name must be in session
4. **Room Number:** Must be available in session

## Known Limitations

### Amenity Requests

- Order ID is set to "N/A" because bulk creation doesn't return individual IDs
- Each amenity sends a separate email (could be batched in future)

### Email Validation

- No validation that guest email is valid before sending
- Failed emails don't retry automatically
- No email queue system (sends immediately)

### Rate Limiting

- No built-in rate limiting for email sends
- Multiple amenities in cart = multiple emails sent simultaneously
- Consider implementing email batching for >5 amenities

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Email Batching:** Combine multiple amenities into single email
2. **Email Queue:** Implement retry logic for failed emails
3. **Email Templates:** Store templates in database for easy editing
4. **Email Preferences:** Allow guests to opt-in/opt-out of notifications
5. **Order Updates:** Send emails on status changes (processing, completed, etc.)
6. **Staff Notifications:** Send copy of email to hotel staff/reception
7. **Email Validation:** Validate guest email before attempting send
8. **Delivery Status:** Track email delivery status (delivered, bounced, etc.)

## Conclusion

Email notification integration is **complete and functional** across all three cart systems. The implementation follows best practices:

✅ Non-blocking error handling  
✅ Consistent email data structure  
✅ Proper guest data extraction  
✅ Edge function integration  
✅ Type-safe TypeScript implementation  
✅ Comprehensive order details in emails

The system is ready for testing and production deployment. Monitor console logs for email failures and consider implementing the suggested enhancements based on usage patterns.
