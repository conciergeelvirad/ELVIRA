## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Updated Data Types

#### Restaurant Interface Extended

Added new fields to `Restaurant` interface in `googlePlaces.service.ts`:

```typescript
// Contact Information
formatted_address?: string;
formatted_phone_number?: string;
international_phone_number?: string;
website?: string;
url?: string; // Google Maps URL

// Opening Hours
opening_hours?: {
  open_now?: boolean;
  weekday_text?: string[]; // Full weekly schedule
};

// Reviews
reviews?: Array<{
  author_name: string;
  rating: number;
  text: string;
  time: number;
  relative_time_description?: string;
  profile_photo_url?: string;
}>;

// Service Options
wheelchair_accessible_entrance?: boolean;
delivery?: boolean;
dine_in?: boolean;
takeout?: boolean;
reservable?: boolean;

// Food & Beverage
serves_breakfast?: boolean;
serves_lunch?: boolean;
serves_dinner?: boolean;
serves_beer?: boolean;
serves_wine?: boolean;
serves_vegetarian_food?: boolean;
```

### Filter Logic

#### Multi-Criteria Filtering

```typescript
const filteredRestaurants = restaurants.filter((restaurant) => {
  // Search query (always active)
  const matchesSearch = ...;

  // Type filter (active when filters on)
  const matchesType = !filterActive || selectedTypes.includes(...);

  // Status filter (active when filters on)
  const matchesStatus = !filterActive || selectedStatuses.includes(...);

  // Rating filter (active when filters on)
  const matchesRating = !filterActive || restaurant.rating >= minRating;

  // Price filter (active when filters on)
  const matchesPriceLevel = !filterActive || selectedPriceLevels.includes(...);

  return matchesSearch && matchesType && matchesStatus &&
         matchesRating && matchesPriceLevel;
});
```

### State Management

Added new filter states:

```typescript
const [minRating, setMinRating] = useState<number>(0);
const [selectedPriceLevels, setSelectedPriceLevels] = useState<number[]>([
  1, 2, 3, 4,
]);
```

### Progressive Filtering

## 📱 Data Sources

All information is sourced from **Google Places API**:

- Contact: phone, website

- Services: delivery, dine-in, takeout options

## 🎓 Documentation Status

## 📞 Support Notes

If Google Places API doesn't return certain fields (reviews, phone, website), those sections will automatically hide in the modal. This is expected behavior and depends on:

1. Data availability in Google's database
2. Place verification status
3. Business owner claiming their listing

For maximum data coverage, consider using **Place Details API** instead of **Nearby Search** for individual restaurant details (requires additional API calls).
