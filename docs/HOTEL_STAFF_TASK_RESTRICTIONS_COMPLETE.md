## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. **TaskForm Component** (`TaskForm.tsx`) - NEW!

- Created custom form component for tasks (similar to StaffForm)
- Accepts `currentUserPosition`, `isEditMode`, and `taskFormFields` props
- Filters fields for Hotel Staff in edit mode:
  - Only shows the **status** field
  - Restricts status options to `IN_PROGRESS` and `COMPLETED`
- Admin/Manager see all fields with all status options

```tsx
if (currentUserPosition === "Hotel Staff" && isEditMode) {
  const restrictedStatusField: FormFieldConfig = {
    ...statusField,
    options: [
      { value: "IN_PROGRESS", label: "In Progress" },
      { value: "COMPLETED", label: "Completed" },
    ],
  };
  return [restrictedStatusField];
}
```

### 2. **CRUDTabContent Component** (`CRUDTabContent.tsx`)

- Updated to conditionally render the Add button
- Only renders button when `addButtonLabel` has a value
- If label is empty string, no button is rendered

```tsx
rightActions={
  addButtonLabel ? (
    <Button variant="dark" leftIcon={addButtonIcon} onClick={onAddClick}>
      {addButtonLabel}
    </Button>
  ) : undefined
}
```

### 3. **HotelStaffPage Component** (`HotelStaffPage.tsx`)

#### Staff Management Tab:

- Add button hidden for Hotel Staff (empty label)
- Edit button only on own profile

#### Task Assignment Tab:

- **Add button hidden for Hotel Staff** (empty label and no icon)
- Hotel Staff can edit only their assigned tasks
- Added `customFormComponent={TaskForm}` with task-specific props
- Added `detailModalActions` to show only Edit button for Hotel Staff
- Added `onEditSubmit` handler for both roles

```tsx
addButtonLabel={isAdminOrManager ? "Add Task" : ""}
addButtonIcon={isAdminOrManager ? Plus : undefined}

onEdit={
  isAdminOrManager
    ? (task) => tasksCRUD.modalActions.openEditModal(task)
    : (task) => {
        if (task.staffId === hotelStaff.hotelStaff?.id) {
          tasksCRUD.modalActions.openEditModal(task);
        }
      }
}

detailModalActions={{
  showEdit: isAdminOrManager || tasksCRUD.modalState.itemToView?.staffId === hotelStaff.hotelStaff?.id,
  showDelete: isAdminOrManager,
}}

customFormComponent={TaskForm}
customFormProps={{
  currentUserPosition: hotelStaff.hotelStaff?.position,
  taskFormFields: taskFormFields,
}}
```
