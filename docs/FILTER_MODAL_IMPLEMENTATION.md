# FilterModal Implementation - ShopPage

## Summary

Created a reusable FilterModal component for the guest pages with a modern, Airbnb-style design.

## Changes Made

### 1. FilterModal Component Created

**Location:** `src/pages/Guests/components/common/FilterModal/`

**Features:**

- ✅ **Price Range Slider** - Single dual-handle range slider (Airbnb-style) with visual track highlighting
- ✅ **Hotel Recommended Toggle** - Show only recommended items
- ✅ **Category Multi-Select** - Pills at the bottom for category filtering
- ✅ **Active Filter Badge** - Shows count of active filters in header
- ✅ **Apply/Reset Buttons** - Sticky footer with action buttons

**Removed:**

- ❌ "In Stock Only" toggle (as requested)
- ❌ Dual separate price sliders (replaced with single range slider)

### 2. FilterOptions Interface

```typescript
interface FilterOptions {
  selectedCategories: string[];
  priceRange: { min: number; max: number };
  showOnlyRecommended: boolean;
}
```

### 3. ShopPage Integration

**State Management:**

- Filter modal state (`isFilterModalOpen`)
- Filter options state (`filters`)
- Dynamic max price calculation from products
- Category fetching from `useProductCategories` hook

**Filter Logic:**

- Search query filter (name + description)
- Category filter (multi-select)
- Price range filter (min-max)
- Recommended items filter

**UI Updates:**

- Filter button opens modal
- Real-time filtering of products
- Console logging for debugging

## Visual Design

### Price Range Slider (Airbnb-style)

- **Single track** with two handles (min/max)
- **Visual highlight** showing selected range in blue
- **Real-time values** displayed at top
- **Touch-optimized** handles with proper z-index layering
- **Smooth animations** for handle movement

### Layout Order

1. **Price Range** (top) - Most frequently used
2. **Hotel Recommended** (middle) - Important filter
3. **Categories** (bottom) - Browse/refine option

### Mobile Optimizations

- Slides up from bottom on mobile
- Full-screen on mobile, centered modal on desktop
- Touch-optimized controls (44px+ targets)
- Sticky header and footer
- Smooth scrolling content

## Files Created

1. **FilterModal.tsx** - Main component
2. **types.ts** - TypeScript interfaces
3. **index.ts** - Exports
4. **README.md** - Documentation

## Files Modified

1. **ShopPage.tsx** - Integrated FilterModal
2. **common/index.ts** - Export FilterModal

## Technical Details

### Price Range Slider Implementation

```tsx
// Track with highlighted active range
<div className="relative h-2 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg">
  <div
    className="absolute h-2 bg-blue-600 rounded-lg"
    style={{
      left: `${(priceRange.min / maxPrice) * 100}%`,
      right: `${100 - (priceRange.max / maxPrice) * 100}%`,
    }}
  />
</div>

// Two overlapping range inputs with styled thumbs
<input type="range" ... /> // Min handle
<input type="range" ... /> // Max handle
```

### Filter Application Flow

1. User opens filter modal (clicks filter button)
2. User adjusts filters (categories, price, recommended)
3. User clicks "Apply Filters"
4. `handleApplyFilters` updates filter state
5. `useMemo` recalculates filtered products
6. UI updates with filtered results

## Next Steps

### Reusability

The FilterModal is designed to be reusable across:

- **DineInPage** - Filter menu items by category, price
- **ServicesPage** - Filter amenities by category, price
- **ExperiencesPage** - Filter experiences by category, price

### Customization Options

Each page can customize:

- Categories list (from their respective hooks)
- Max price (calculated from their data)
- Filter logic (in their useMemo)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Filter modal opens/closes correctly
- [ ] Price range slider moves smoothly
- [ ] Both handles can be moved independently
- [ ] Min handle can't pass max handle (and vice versa)
- [ ] Category pills toggle correctly
- [ ] Recommended toggle works
- [ ] Active filter count updates correctly
- [ ] Reset button clears all filters
- [ ] Apply button applies filters and closes modal
- [ ] Products filter correctly based on selections
- [ ] Mobile responsive (slides up from bottom)
- [ ] Desktop centered modal display
- [ ] Touch targets are large enough (44px+)

## Design Inspiration

The dual-handle price range slider is inspired by Airbnb's filter design:

- Single track with two handles
- Visual highlight of selected range
- Real-time value display
- Smooth drag interactions
- Mobile-optimized touch targets
