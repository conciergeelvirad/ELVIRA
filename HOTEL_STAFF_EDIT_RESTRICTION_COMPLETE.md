# Hotel Staff Edit Restriction Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Feature**: Role-based field restrictions for Hotel Staff editing

## 📋 Overview

Implemented role-based access control so that staff members with `position="Hotel Staff"` can only edit personal data fields in the Edit Staff Member form, while administrators and managers can edit all fields.

## 🎯 Requirements

- ✅ Hotel Staff can only view and edit **personal data** fields:

  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Date of Birth
  - City
  - Zip Code
  - Address
  - Emergency Contact Name
  - Emergency Contact Number

- ✅ Hotel Staff **cannot edit**:

  - Position
  - Department
  - Employee ID
  - Hire Date
  - Status

- ✅ Hotel Staff can **only edit their own profile**
- ✅ Admins and Managers can edit all fields for all staff members
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. **StaffForm Component** (`StaffForm.tsx`)

- Added `currentUserPosition` and `isEditMode` props
- Implemented field filtering logic using `PERSONAL_DATA_FIELDS` constant
- Added console logging to track field filtering
- Uses `useMemo` to optimize field filtering

```tsx
// Personal data fields that "Hotel Staff" can edit
const PERSONAL_DATA_FIELDS = [
  "name",
  "email",
  "phone",
  "dateOfBirth",
  "city",
  "zipCode",
  "address",
  "emergencyContactName",
  "emergencyContactNumber",
];

// Filter fields based on user position and mode
if (currentUserPosition === "Hotel Staff" && isEditMode) {
  fields = fields.filter((field) => PERSONAL_DATA_FIELDS.includes(field.key));
}
```

### 2. **StaffDataView Component** (`StaffDataView.tsx`) - NEW!

- Added `currentUserId` and `isAdminOrManager` props
- Conditionally shows Edit/Delete buttons based on user role and ownership
- Hotel Staff: Only see Edit button on their own card/row
- Admin/Manager: See Edit and Delete buttons on all cards/rows
- Added logging to track button visibility decisions

```tsx
// Determine which actions to show
const canEdit = isAdminOrManager || staff.id === currentUserId;
const canDelete = isAdminOrManager;

<CardActionFooter
  onEdit={canEdit && onEdit ? () => onEdit(staff) : undefined}
  onDelete={canDelete && onDelete ? () => onDelete(staff) : undefined}
/>;
```

### 3. **CRUDModalContainer Component** (`CRUDModalContainer.tsx`)

- Extended interface to accept `customFormProps` (additional props for custom forms)
- Added `isEditMode` prop passed to form components
- Changed prop types from `any` to `unknown` for TypeScript compliance
- Fixed unused error variables in catch blocks

```tsx
customFormComponent?: React.ComponentType<{
  formState: CRUDFormState;
  formActions: CRUDFormActions;
  disabled?: boolean;
  isEditMode?: boolean;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}>;
customFormProps?: Record<string, unknown>;
```

### 3. **CRUDTabContent Component** (`CRUDTabContent.tsx`)

- Added `detailModalActions` prop to control edit/delete button visibility
- Passes `customFormProps` and `detailModalActions` to `CRUDModalContainer`

### 4. **useStaffCRUD Hook** (`useStaffCRUD.tsx`)

- **CRITICAL FIX**: Modified update logic to conditionally include `staffUpdates`
- Only sends position/department updates if those fields are present in form data
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

```tsx
// Only include staffUpdates if position and department are present
let staffUpdates = undefined;
if (data.position && data.department) {
  staffUpdates = {
    position: data.position as string,
    department: data.department as string,
  };
}
```

### 5. **HotelStaffPage Component** (`HotelStaffPage.tsx`)

- Updated `onEdit` handler to allow Hotel Staff to edit only their own profile
- Updated `onEditSubmit` to allow both admins and Hotel Staff to submit edits
- Added `detailModalActions` to control edit/delete button visibility in detail modal
- Added `customFormProps` to pass current user position to form

```tsx
onEdit={
  isAdminOrManager
    ? (staff) => {
        console.log("👤 Admin/Manager editing staff:", staff.id);
        staffCRUD.modalActions.openEditModal(staff);
      }
    : (staff) => {
        // Allow Hotel Staff to edit only their own profile
        if (staff.id === hotelStaff.hotelStaff?.id) {
          console.log("👤 Hotel Staff editing own profile:", staff.id);
          staffCRUD.modalActions.openEditModal(staff);
        }
      }
}

detailModalActions={{
  showEdit: isAdminOrManager || staffCRUD.modalState.itemToView?.id === hotelStaff.hotelStaff?.id,
  showDelete: isAdminOrManager,
}}
```

2. Navigate to Hotel Staff page
3. Click on any staff member
4. Click "Edit" button
5. Verify all fields are editable
6. Save changes
7. Verify console logs show admin editing

### Test as Hotel Staff:

1. Log in as a user with position "Hotel Staff" (not Manager department)
2. Navigate to Hotel Staff page
3. Click on another staff member
4. Verify NO edit button appears
5. Click on your own profile
6. Verify edit button appears
7. Click "Edit"
8. Verify only personal data fields are shown (no position/department)
9. Make changes to personal fields
10. Save changes
11. Verify console logs show field restrictions and update process

### Console Log Verification:

Open browser console and look for:

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Field restrictions are enforced at the **UI level**
- Backend RLS policies should also restrict what Hotel Staff can update
- Consider adding server-side validation to ensure:
  - Hotel Staff cannot update position/department fields
  - Hotel Staff can only update their own records

## 🎉 Summary

The implementation successfully restricts Hotel Staff members to editing only their personal data fields while maintaining full editing capabilities for administrators and managers. The solution includes comprehensive logging for debugging and follows React best practices with proper TypeScript typing.
