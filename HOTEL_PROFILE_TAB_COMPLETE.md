### Modified Files:

1. **`components/settings/index.ts`**

   - Added `HotelProfileTab` export

2. **`pages/Hotel/SettingsPage.tsx`**
   - Replaced EmptyState with HotelProfileTab
   - Imported new component

## Usage

The Profile tab is now the first tab in Settings and shows comprehensive hotel information with proper access control.

### User Experience:

1. Navigate to Settings page
2. Profile tab shows by default (or click Profile tab)
3. See hotel information organized in blocks
4. Admins/Managers see additional Payment section
5. All staff see their role badge at the bottom

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Stripe Account ID Protection:**

- Server-side validation should also restrict this field
- RLS policies on `hotels` table should be verified
- Only authorized roles can view sensitive payment data

‚úÖ **Role Detection:**

- Uses `useHotelStaff` hook for current user role
- Checks position === "Hotel Admin" OR (position === "Hotel Staff" AND department === "Manager")
- Computed once with `useMemo` for performance
